# ðŸ§ª Data Lab

**Data Lab** is a repository showcasing a portfolio of data science projects completed for academic purposes, self-learning, and personal interests. The projects are presented in the form of Jupyter notebooks.

## ðŸ“Œ Goals

- Track my progress in learning data science
- Build a portfolio of real-world projects
- Experiment with data analysis and machine learning techniques
- Practice using Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and more

## ðŸš€ Projects

- ### ðŸ“Š Machine Learning:

  - Python
    - [Predicting Boston Houses Prices](https://github.com/lxcnse/data-lab/tree/main/mini-projects/boston_housing): Built a model to predict Boston housing prices and identify optimal selling points using machine learning

- ### ðŸ“ˆ Data Analysis and Visualisation:

- ### ðŸ§© Mini Projects
  - R
    - [Dating App User Behavior Analysis](https://github.com/lxcnse/data-lab/tree/main/mini-projects/dating_site_goals): This project analyzes dating app survey data to predict users Reasons for Using the app based on demographics and usage patterns using decision tree models.
    - [Linear Regression Project](https://github.com/lxcnse/data-lab/tree/main/mini-projects/linear-regression-carseats): Performing a linear regression analysis on the Carseats dataset from the ISLR package. The goal of the analysis is to examine the relationship between explanatory variables and the sales of car seats.

## ðŸ“Ž How to Use

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lxcnse/data-lab.git
   cd data-lab
   ```
2. **Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended):**

- For windows
  ```bash
  python -m venv venv
  .\venv\Scripts\activate
  ```
- For MacOS/Linux
  ```bash
  python3 -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

3. **Install requirements:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run Python Scripts / Notebooks:**

   Navigate to the notebooks you want to explore and execute the code within them.

   Alternatively, you can run any Python scripts or notebooks directly from the command line:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook path/to/your_notebook.ipynb
   ```
